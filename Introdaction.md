2. Of course, the email will be validated by our email system **before** the first time of the login.
3. If users forget their password, it can be modified online after the **email validation**
4. There is a **personal info page** on the website, where users are able to update their personal info like the name and password. 

### poll Application

2. Visitors can read all the poll by **specific searching**, **Category** or **random looking through**, but they must be **registered users**  if they have an attempt to vote. Otherwise, visitors would be noticed to register or login
3. Once visitors find the specific poll and click in, the **comments of past voters** and **voting panel** will be displayed.
4. After the voting, the **result** will be discovered, meanwhile, current user's **comment** of this topic will appear simultaneously.
