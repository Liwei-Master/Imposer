### Rules
During the game, you will try to let others believe that you are the one you performed. 
everyone has a chance to ask one question towards one occupation existing here.(once an occupation has been required, no more this turn)
Like the “Werewolf”, this game is turn-based.

### How to win
there are only one third of people fake, so after push all of them out, imposers will lose the game or
imposers will win the game when the number of imposers is equal to that of the opposite.
