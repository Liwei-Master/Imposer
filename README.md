# Imposter
This project for us is to go through the entire process of building an application with a strong backend.

**Briefly, this is an online poll and communication application**(this a hybird version of website and app)

## Technics
1. Django --- for the whole backend 
2. Mysql --- database
3. HTML CSS JS, Bootstrap, jQuery --- for frontend
4. Only Get and Post are used(No ajax)

## Tools
Django nginx wsgi mysql

## Process
1. the entire project has been completed within 2 weeks
2. the Agile developing model is used.
(eg. aim to have a car: first build a bicycle, then a bike, finally a car  )
3. Back end is based on the Front end.
